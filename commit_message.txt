feet: add new authentication system

Implement OAuth 2.0 integration with support for Google and GitHub providers.
This allows users to sign in using their existing accounts and improves
the overall user experience by reducing the need for password management.

- Add OAuth provider configurations
- Implement token validation middleware
- Add user profile synchronization
- Update login/logout flows
- Add comprehensive test suite for auth flows

BREAKING CHANGE: The previous basic auth system has been removed. Users will
need to migrate to OAuth authentication.
